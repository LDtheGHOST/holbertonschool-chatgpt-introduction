ChatGPT - Introduction

Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT

Objectives

Debugging: Understand the practical use of AI in identifying and solving coding errors. You will use ChatGPT to diagnose and correct bugs in provided code samples across multiple programming languages. This will enhance your problem-solving skills and understanding of common programming pitfalls in a diverse set of coding environments.
Automation: Learn how to automate mundane and repetitive coding tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT. This involves generating boilerplate code, documentation, and even basic unit tests, freeing up time to focus on more complex and creative aspects of software development.
Outcomes

Enhanced Debugging Skills: Gain confidence in troubleshooting and refining code, with an ability to articulate problems clearly and implement AI-driven solutions effectively.
Automation Proficiency: Develop skills to leverage AI for automating coding tasks, leading to more structured and error-free code.

Remember to test, verify, and critically evaluate the information provided by ChatGPT. Don’t hesitate to question or double-check the responses to ensure their accuracy and relevance to your needs.
